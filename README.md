My site is hosted by the nice folks at Github on their pages platform
with [Jekyll] at http://devrintalen.net.

The [project wiki][1] is a little light on the bootstrapping portion,
so if you get stuck I recommend remembering the following:

- Jekyll doesn't care about anything in `_pages`.

- You need to create your own `index.html`, Jekyll doesn't make it for
  you.

- Don't use `{% include foo %}` to link to media like images, instead
  put them in a folder like `img` and Jekyll will copy that over to
  your site.

This site's layout:

    _attachments: unused, should be deleted
    _includes: unused currently
    _layouts
        default.html: base layout, <body> is blank
        post.html: individual posts
    _posts: duh.
    css
    img
    js
    index.html
    about.html
    projects.html

Feel free to use my configuration and/or layout as inspiration for
your own site, but blatant copying will cause me to frown and be
mildly irritated (but I'll get over it).
