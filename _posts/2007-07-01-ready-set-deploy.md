So it's been a month or so in the making, but aneviltrend is now
hosted by my trusty old desktop instead of at [1portfolio][1]. They
were alright, but a recent outage (and no apology) made me realize
that I needed to switch. Also, I had plans to migrate this site to the
[Django framework][2], which 1portfolio didn't support.

Well, that's all complete now. Aneviltrend is powered by Django and
Apache, and it seems to be humming along happily. I'm using
[dyndns][3] for a dynamic dns solution, so no matter where I move the
desktop, I'm set.

You'll see that the feature set is very similar. Aside from the
absence of the gallery, everything that was on the [old site][4] is
here, in some form or another. Django made the process incredibly easy
(but now I have to learn python). Overall, I'm happy with the
transition. I also like the control I have now over what happens on my
site.

Stay tuned!
