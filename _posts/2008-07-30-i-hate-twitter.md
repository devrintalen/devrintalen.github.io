title: I Hate Twitter and Yes, Thank You, I Did Take My Pills This Morning
---

Three weeks ago I pulled the plug on my [Twitter] account. Almost a
year ago I had fallen head over heels for that service, and when I
finally cut the cord I felt as if I had pulled my head out of the
internet's ass and took a breath of fresh air.

Twitter is the cool kid's table all over again. It's a
positive-feedback system that perpetuates the position of those with
the most followers and steals the lunch money from the nerds. Sour
grapes, I know. But hear me out.

Meet Devrin
-----------

Devrin just signed up for Twitter. Exciting! He posts a message:

> Hello, world!

Not brilliant, but it'll do for an inaugural post. Besides, he has so
much to tell the world! He'll beguile the internet with his
140-character wit and steal their hearts! He'll have many thousands of
followers!

Devrin recovers from his unbridled enthusiasm and ventures into
Twitter's deep bowels. "I must find someone to follow," he thinks. And
follow he does: the first victim is none other than [John Gruber][df],
[Merlin Mann][43f] follows, and [Steven Frank][sf] is felled soon
thereafter. Devrin goes to his timeline and admires it. His post,
alongside the likes of those three! He feels moved to post again:

> This is super cool!

And quits Twitter forever --- or not. He should have. In reality it
took 52 weeks and a few hundred "tweets" before he gathered the
intestinal fortitude to do it.

Some Background
---------------

When Twitter was released it garnered naught but harsh words. No one
could see any merit in a system that restricted you to 140
characters. "It's a waste of bandwidth," they decided. And moved on.

Twitter exploded a little more than a year later. Suddenly bloggers
decided that Twitter was the Next Big Thing and rang up
accounts. Their dutiful readerships followed suit, creating accounts
for the sole purpose --- as I did --- of reading their favorite
blogger's tweets. And bloggers *loved it*: their audience at their
fingertips! Have a question? No problem! Tweet it and --- zing! ---
you've got answers!

The unexpected explosion melted Twitter's servers. And now the Big
Thing to blog was Twitter's unreliability: what kind of
self-respecting service has hours of downtime? And the slashdot effect
increased Twitter's problems. And users. Today, a bit later, things
seem to be running more stably.

Hey You Up There! Twitter Sucks!
--------------------------------

Why did Twitter's first reviewers find so much to hate? They had *no
audience*.  Twitter was like writting letters and dropping them on the
ground. A little while later these same people were back on Twitter
lavishing praise because --- neat! --- all of sudden there were all
these people that *wanted* to read this crap you threw on the ground!
Before 140 characters was an arbitrary limitation, now it's "inspired"
and "revolutionary." What the heck changed?

The people calling the shots now like Twitter. It's this New Medium
that connects people. In reality it's a big rat race for followers and
favorited tweets. Not for those on the top --- for those on the
bottom. The basement of Twitter is one big Digg comment thread; it's
the usual mix of ep1c fa1lz, brb bathroom, and OMG! coot puppys! It's
as if you could create a site that looked like Facebook to the guys on
top and MySpace to those beneath.

The only people that anyone follows --- even the popular users --- are
the popular users. Strange! This is how Twitter fails: **there's no
way to discover users.** Sure, point me to the search bar. Point me to
"follows" list on everyone's page. But there's no way for me to find
users that talk about the same stuff I do. Twitter doesn't put me in
touch with these people. Twitter doesn't forge new connections, it
only reproduces the blog & audience relationship that already
exists. That's how Twitter fails. That's why Twitter sucks.

Twitter is your high school lunchroom where the uncool kids are too
busy peering over each other to get a glimpse of the cool table to
even notice each other.

One Year Later
--------------

And so a year later, thoroughly disillusioned, I pull the plug. Some
will read this and agree.

But the vast majority will --- I feel --- think, "You dolt. You can't
say *you* don't like Twitter and because of that Twitter as a whole
sucks." Point taken.  Maybe there are those that actually have friends
on Twitter --- how'd you swing that? --- or those that use it because
they enjoy reading tweets from those on high. Fair enough. But to the
latter: that's not what Twitter is for. They provide RSS feeds if
that's all you want.

Too many people join Twitter because they hear that it's awesome. This
is to you: don't. It's not.
