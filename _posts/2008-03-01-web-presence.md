title: Web Presence
---

I've been signing up for an alarming amount of web apps lately. Nearly
every site that I visit asks me to put down my name before it'll let
me in. And, sucker that I am, I tend to use my [real name][1].

spreading thin
---------------

Where am I on the net?

- AIM
- This site
- Tumblr
- Twitter
- Google mail, docs, groups, etc.
- Blogspot
- Facebook
- Last.fm, Pandora
- Slashdot
- Plan 9 & gEDA mailing lists
- deviantART
- Parallax: [mobile desk chair project][mdcp]

Quite a list. I'm making no claims here though: you may have more or
less. The point is, though, that our every move on the web is
captured. If I post to the Plan 9 mailing list my [Google] will list
that post as my top search result.  What if that post was a nasty
reply? What if it was just plain stupid? That post is archived by
hundreds of sites. It's not getting lost.

being careful
-------------

Granted it's easy to simply *not care*. So what if a Google search of
my name turns up someone who [trolls forums][2] and pesters mailing
lists?  The easy answer: that it really doesn't matter. How many
people search for me online? How many would, if they saw those posts,
even know me? Will these sites even be around ten years down the road?

And if you don't use your real name then that answer might
suffice. The anonymity of the internet makes it easy to be multiple
people. But I'd like to focus on those that are trying to cultivate a
presence. Just like the "real world" your name on the internet carries
weight. It carries your image. And with how prominent the internet has
become it's beginning to carry a significant amount of your identity.

I believe that we take these online personas for granted. With every
web app that gets released we have another opportunity to create yet
another identity. Unlike our analog counterpart that forgets and is
forgotten, the web identity you create is permanent. The internet,
cruel mistress that she is, will never lose that terrifically
embarrassing photo. Or video. Or [post][3].
