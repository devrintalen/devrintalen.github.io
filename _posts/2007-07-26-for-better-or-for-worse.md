title:  for better or for worse

I was feeling adventurous yesterday and decided to try a different
mail client.  I've been using [Apple Mail][1], and as much as I love
it, it's just not a full-featured email client. I need better filters,
better spam handling, and so forth.

Granted, this wasn't an issue a few years ago when I started using
Mail. But I feel like I've outgrown Mail's capabilities, and that I
could use more.

Enter the search for a better email client. Yesterday I gave both
[Mailsmith][2] and [Thunderbird][3] a try, and I've noticed
something. As much as I want to use these, it's almost like I
can't. The [siren song][4] of Apple's tight software/hardware
integration is nigh impossible to resist.

And it's not just the software integration. Having iTunes sync with
your iPod is just magical. Making the switch to a PSP was tough, but
worth it in the end. The compelling factor in that, though, was that
all my music got converted to MP3's in the process. I think I can
apply the same logic to getting a new mail client.  Mailsmith stores
mail in an [mbox format][5], which is plenty open. In the end, it all
comes down to making the switch, and just making sure that whatever
you switch to, you can switch *out of it* when you need to.
