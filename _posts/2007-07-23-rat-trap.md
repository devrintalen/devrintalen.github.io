the current state
-----------------

You may or may not have given much thought to the window manager you
use every day on your \*nix box, but it really defines how you interact
with (and think about) your computer. Chances are you're either
running [KDE][1] or [Gnome][2]. Both are fine window managers, but
they really go beyond that. They're full *desktop environments*,
giving you a desktop with a place for icons, menu bars on the top
and/or bottom, and nice good-looking windows that you can drag around
and minimize.

[2]: http://www.gnome.org

For many, this is fine. But try to notice how much time you're
spending just dragging windows around, minimizing and maximizing them
just to get the most out of your screen. Most of the time you'll open
up an application and immediately have to resize and/or move it to a
different part of the screen.

the alternative exists
----------------------

If you're comfortable using your computer, or would just like to try
out something new, I'd like to suggest that you try a *tiling* window
manager.  Essentially, you let the window manager do what it should
--- **manage your windows**.

No menu bars, no window decorations, *no windows*. Yes, it does sound
scary! But trust me, it's a far better experience when all you want to
do is actually use your computer. I guess a picture speaks for a
thousand words, so here's a screenshot:

Doesn't look like much, does it now? Well, it's not supposed to. The
idea is that you divide your screen into *frames*, which can be
further subdivided horizontally or vertially. The other main point is
that *windows cannot overlap*. Just think about how many times you
find yourself needing to focus to a window that's partially hidden by
your current window, usually just to see some small amount of
text. Sure, alt-tabbing is pretty fast, but it's annoying nonetheless.
Not allowing windows to overlap will probably drastically change how
you create windows and think about applications. You can't resize
applications, because they always take up the extents of the frame
that they're running in.

making the switch
-----------------

The most compelling statement I've read about tiling window managers
is written by Tuomo Valkonen, the creator of [ion][3], the first of
the tiling window managers.  I quote (but you should definitely give
the full article a good read on the ion homepage):

I've only recently begun to use a tiling window manager, and I'm
finding it's loads faster and more efficient than Gnome or KDE. A
point to remember is that you're not getting rid of the mouse ---
you're just changing your way of interacting with the window
manager. Instead of dragging windows around and minimizing them, you
run apps in frames and divide up the screen. You'll still use the
mouse to interact with apps, and they still work like normal.  The
idea is that you're more efficient with the keyboard, so why not use
it more often?

How easy is it to switch? About one line, at least if you're using
[Ubuntu][4] or another Debian-based machine. I wouldn't expect the
build process to be overly difficult, however, and might actually give
you better results if you like to tweak options. Most of the popular
window managers are available via `apt-get`, and after installation
the option to use your sparkling new window manager should be
available on the login screen. Just set your session to whatever you
want.

some tiling window managers I've found
--------------------------------------

This list is far from complete, but I'm pretty sure it has most of the
major players:

- [ion3][3]: The first of its kind, and definitely still
  popular. Likes to use the function keys for global commands. I'm not
  a fan of how you resize frames, but that's probably just me.

- [wmii][5]: My current weapon of choice. I haven't quite grok'd it
  yet, but it seems very easy to use and forgiving.

- [dwm][6]: Way small, and way fast. To change any configuration, you
  have to edit the source and recompile.

- [ratpoison][7]: Old, but still popular and with a loyal
  following. Check out [command line warriors][8] and search for
  ratpoison. This kid likes to use it.

- [stumpwm][9]:: The successor to ratpoison. Described as emacs-like,
  mainly because of the Lisp roots and the keyboard shortcuts.

Be sure to check some of these out! Install a few, play around with
them, and remember that you can always switch back to Gnome or KDE
with no hitch if it's not your cup of tea.
