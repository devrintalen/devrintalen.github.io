# About Me

![](/img/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Devrin Talen and I like to [code](https://github.com/devrintalen), solder, and hang out with my family.

I live in an Emacs world; evil with a helping of org-mode. I like to write with LaTeX. I hack on a desktop that runs a very nicely configured Gentoo system.

Feel free to get in touch with me over [email](mailto:dct23@cornell.edu). You can also get a copy of [my resume](/devrintalen.pdf).
